The first activity was to calibrate the system in Loch Eriboll and St Magnus Bay. During the cruise, records were taken of schools of herring, pearlsides (Maurolicus muelleri) and mackerel. Analysis of these data included enhancement of the processing software to improve the estimation of volume backscattering strength spectra. Unfortunately, the mackerel were not present in the expected areas of the survey and only after searching extensively to the extreme north east of the North Sea were mackerel schools found. Only one school was sampled with the fishing trawl: the average fish size in this catch was 33 cm. The equivalent estimates of mackerel size as calculated from the sonar data was 21.5 cm. Although this is close to what was observed in the catch, it is not as close as is required. Clearly more data is required to tune the sizing algorithm using more catch data of various sizes. Enhancements to the algorithm and scattering model on which it is based are also required.

In many cases the exploitation rates align closely with MSY principles. If these stocks also have accepted age-structured assessments based on catch and survey data, then these are used to determine the advice. Examples include North sea herring or saithe. Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) Where no agreed international management plan exists, the default ICES position for stocks with full accepted assessments is to base advice on a fishing mortality rate (known as FMSY) that is expected to generate the MSY for the participating fleets: that is, the highest possible catch that can be maintained indefinitely. Examples include the haddock stock (IIIa, IV and VIa). This approach has superseded the precautionary approach (PA), although PA biomass reference points are still in use for some stocks and PA advice is still listed. The biomass reference point is used as a \u2018trigger\u2019 - if the stock drops below this size, then F is adjusted downwards below FMSY. MSY (or, more specifically, FMSY) can be very difficult to estimate, and proxies to it are often used. It may be different in single-species and multi-species contexts, but it is generally the case that FMSY is less than the historical fishing mortality rate experienced by a stock. Hence a requirement to fish at or around FMSY usually leads to a reduction in fishing mortality, and a concomitant increase in sustainability. \u2018Data-poor\u2019 stocks For all other stocks, the form of the ICES advice is principally determined by the requirements of the advice customer, which for ICES is often the European Commission (EC). In an attempt to force member states to monitor and submit detailed data on all their fisheries, in 2011 the EC decided that only stocks with full, age-structured analytic assessments could be managed according to management plans or MSY considerations. All other stocks, including those with only (for example) research-vessel survey data, would be managed according to advice based on the following table. While the intention to improve data provision is laudable, questions need to be asked about whether a rigid approach to the type of assessments that are acceptable is appropriate. Robust assessments using different approaches also need to be considered. For now, the consequences of the consistent application of the table are that many stocks for which reasonable indicators of stock abundance exist are subject to quota cuts because these data do not fit a particular paradigm. Examples include Northern Shelf monkfish.","description":"\u003Cp\u003EDescription of the state of the fish and shellfish stocks of commercial importance to the Scottish fishing fleet.

The principal exceptions were rays (there is little market demand for small rays) and ling (where most discarded fish are below the minimum landing size). The results have also identified small, but regular, discards of pelagic species such as herring and mackerel in the whitefish fishery.

A miniature radio transmitter was inserted into each fish so that they could be tracked to their spawning locations. Genetic samples were taken from each of these fish, and many other salmon from the nets, with the aim of relating genetic variation to geographic population structuring within the South Esk catchment. Altogether, 24 spring salmon were tracked successfully until spawning time over three years. Of this sample, 20 fish (83.3 %) spawned in the upper catchment in either Glen Clova (16 fish) or Glen Prosen (4 fish). The other 4 fish (16.7 %) spawned in the middle reaches of the river. It was not possible to use genetic tools (single nucleotide polymorphisms - SNPs) to identify geographic origins within the catchment due to relatively low levels of genetic differentiation between the geographic areas investigated. The status of the juvenile salmon stock Multiple-pass electrofishing was conducted in the River South Esk in 2013 and 2014 in sites from both the upper and lower catchment. These data were supplemented with historical data gathered in 2004, 2005 and 2011. The observed density of salmon fry at each site was compared with a national average abundance associated with broadly similar conditions. Model residuals (observed - expected) were examined to see whether sites were performing better or worse than expected in comparison with the national level. Nine out of the thirteen sites surveyed in the upper South Esk during 2014 remained above expectation, providing reasonable evidence that the upper catchment as a whole was well populated by salmon fry relative to the average national expectation. Furthermore, sites in the upper catchment were generally more productive for salmon relative to expectations than those in the lower catchment. In the upper catchment, sites in Glen Clova were generally better than those in Glen Prosen. In the lower catchment, sites in the Pow Burn and the Lemno Burn were notably poor for salmon fry, whereas high densities of salmon fry relative to expectation were present in the Noran Water. Spring rod fishing effort The six rod fisheries that contribute most to the spring salmon rod catch on the River South Esk were contacted and information on fishing effort was requested. Effort data, in the form of bookings from 2002 to 2012, were received from one fishery proprietor. \u201cLow definition\u201d data for 2002 to 2006 indicated whether or not a given beat was let on a given day. \u201cHigh definition\u201d data for 2007 to 2012 also included information on the number of rods booked on each beat day let. Trends in catch per unit of effort (CPUE) varied from trends in reported catch. It was also possible to identify trends in the high definition data which were not apparent in the low definition data. It is concluded that while measuring fishing effort may increase the reliability of fishery data as a proxy for stock abundance, such data need to be of a sufficiently high quality. Geographic exploitation of the coastal net fishery Radio tagged spring salmon sourced from the coastal net fishery in 2012 and 2013 were used to estimate the proportion of the catch destined to spawn in the River South Esk. Tagged fish were detected in several major rivers in the northeast and east of Scotland including the Spey, Don, Dee (Aberdeenshire), North Esk, South Esk and Tay. The proportion of the catch destined to spawn in the River South Esk was estimated at 8 % to 25 % in 2012, and at 11 % to 29 % in 2013. Genetic methods (SNPs) could not be used to determine the representation of different rivers stocks in the nets. This was because there is not enough differentiation detectable among the large east coast rivers.

Initially, VMS pings were filtered by speed (0\u0026lt; speed \u0026lt;5 knots) to distinguish fishing from steaming. Then, fishing pings were merged with landings data (i.e. logbooks). To avoid landings mis-allocation, fishing pings were assigned to overlapping ICES rectangles. Reported landings data were broken down by reported day and the daily landings in each ICES rectangle were equally distributed for those assigned pings in that day. All pings within a 2.5 km2 radius of major fishing ports were removed since the speed threshold applied during filtering, included periods of relatively low speed as vessels approached port areas. Total trip landings associated with removed pings were re-allocated to all remaining pings of each trip. Non-parametric density analysis was selected over the commonly used quadrate count to develop GIS layers describing annual distribution of fisheries. A Gaussian kernel density estimation with a data-driven bandwidth selection approach (smoothed cross-validation) had been used resulting in high quality contour maps which form a better estimate of the spatial extent of fishing activity and intensity. Several years\u2019 data have been amalgamated and effectively showed spatial patterns in high-resolution for both intense and infrequently fished areas throughout that period.

Salmon are now the target of large conservation actions due to growing concerns about their population status and the potential impacts of human activities on their productivity. To adequately assess the current and future status of salmon populations, accurate estimates of their population sizes are needed. In Scotland, electronic fish counter technology has been the cornerstone methodology used to accurately assess salmon population sizes. Marine Scotland Science (MSS) seeks to expand the current counter distribution to include new counter sites throughout Scotland. An expanded network will provide valuable information for salmon fisheries management, sustainable marine planning, the development of renewable energy, and the growth of aquaculture.

A total weight and number of individuals for each species is recorded. Length frequency data is collected from a representative sample of each species. This dataset is a summary of the main database and comprises information on total number and weight per hour of trawling for each species for each year. NperHr = number of individuals caught per hour of trawling, averaged across hauls in a year. KgperHr = biomass of individuals caught per hour of trawling (in kg), averaged across hauls in a year. SpeciesCode = a three letter Marine Scotland reference code. This data set was used in the publication written in collaboration with University of Sheffield \u2018Mindel et al. 2015. A trait-based metric sheds new light on the nature of the body size\u2013depth relationship in the deep sea. J. Anim. Ecol.

However, a thorough understanding of the tagging information was constrained by a lack of knowledge of where the salmon were headed before their tags detached. Here, genetic assignment techniques are used in order to investigate the origins of salmon satellite-tagged at Armadale on the north coast of Scotland. The marine distribution of tagged fish assigned to different parts of Scotland showed no obvious pattern.

The results of the Wyre experiments are reported here, undertaken on board the fishing vessel Three Boys (K905, skipper Emlyn Grieve) at a location to the south of the island (59\u00b06.48\u2019N, 2\u00b057.93W). The survey line was marked out by a heavy sinking rope, left in situ between fishing occasions. Fishing covered a strip of 2 m either side of the rope, and the length of rope covered (and marked for future reference) was 178 m, determined by the coverage of the first bout of fishing. The survey area was thus 712 m2. Fishing was undertaken by a team of four divers employing their usual hand-gathering technique but collecting all sizes of scallops encountered. All scallops captured on each bout of fishing were counted and measured (shell height and width). All scallops not retained for landing were returned to the survey area, distributed along the line by a diver placing scallops on the sea bed. Three fishing bouts were completed on each occasion, limited by dive time and diminishing catch rates. The five depletion fishing occasions were 25 June, 8 August, 7 October and 18 November 2013, and 13 June 2014.

A process-centred demographic analysis of a phenotypically mixed population (river North Esk, eastern Scotland) separated the life-cycle into two portions: density-dependent (spawner to smolt), represented by a stock-recruitment relationship; density-independent at sea and in both the estuary and river during return to spawning sites. Extensive data spanning three decades was judiciously used to parameterise the model for three phenotypically distinct sub-stocks (early-running multi-sea-winter; late-running multi-sea-winter; and one-sea-winter). Quantification of different population parameters was achieved for the putative sub-stocks, illuminating historical population-trends and underlying mechanisms. The approach forms a template for similar model decompositions at other rivers with similar data. Broad implications for salmon management more widely included the enhanced benefits of a process-based life-cycle model that described more phenotypically homogeneous sub-stocks (than a single-stock formulation) for the transport of population parameter values (or derived Biological Reference Points) from well documented (parameter-donor) catchments to data-sparse (parameter-recipient) catchments.

However, there are significant challenges associated with the analysis of populations at the sub-river scale. This report investigates the potential for assessment of fish populations at a sub-river scale. A sophisticated mathematical model was used to separate salmon from a single river (North Esk, eastern Scotland) into three sub-stocks, based on the number of years the adults have spent at sea (their sea-age) and the month of the year in which the adults return to freshwater to breed (their run-timing).\u003C\/p\u003E","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"pdf","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.scotland.gov.uk\/Resource\/0048\/00488018.pdf","title":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Vol 6 No 12"}],"identifier":"87f5a604-59cb-48aa-8b25-097c4399d590","issued":"2016-01-14","keyword":["Atlantic Salmon","fish stocks","freshwater fisheries","mathematical modelling","Salmo salar"],"landingPage":"http:\/\/data.marine.gov.scot\/dataset\/demography-phenotypically-mixed-atlantic-salmon-salmo-salar-population-discerned-eastern","modified":"2016-01-14","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Reports, Freshwater"},"temporal":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\/2015-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","title":"The demography of a phenotypically mixed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) population as discerned for an eastern Scottish river","bureauCode":["000:00"],"programCode":["000:000"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"fn":"Marine Scotland Science","hasEmail":"mailto:noemailprovided@usa.gov"},"describedBy":"The general purpose of this collision risk model update is to further develop the application of the Band model using a simulation approach to incorporate variability and uncertainty. In this report we refer to variability as the inherent heterogeneity of the environment and uncertainty as a lack of data or incomplete knowledge. The simulation model randomly samples from distributions for each of the model parameters and the simulations can then be used to derive average collision estimates, with associated confidence intervals. The model update will therefore allow for a better understanding of the uncertainty associated with the predicted collision impact of a wind farm development and provide confidence limits, something which has previously been absent. In addition, the incorporation of uncertainty would reduce the possibility that a collision estimate was driven by the choice of a single input parameter value. Ultimately, the update should aid streamlining of the planning\/consenting stages of a development by providing information not only on the magnitude of collisions i.e. the number of collision events, but also the likelihood of that number of collisions occurring. In this model update, variability and uncertainty are considered together in combination, rather than separately. Some model input parameters will have associated variability, for example bird body length, others may be expected to be point estimates with associated uncertainty, such as turbine rotor radius, and some parameters may have both variability and uncertainty. Ideally it would be possible to differentiate between variability and uncertainty but at present this is not possible due to a lack of data. However, including variability and uncertainty in combination in the model still provides a significant step forward.

Outputs from the unit for each ping include; vessel name, position, generated date and time of ping, speed, course, whether a satellite was overhead at the time of the ping, and the date and time the ping was received. The unit calculates instantaneous speed for each ping and then assigns a \u2018speed bin value\u2019 in knots starting at 0 knots with incremental increases of 2 knots thereafter. These \u2018speed bin values\u2019 are what is exported by the system. VMS units were offered to fishermen on a voluntary basis with the most active scallop dredge vessels approached for inclusion in the project. There were 36 SSMO licenced vessels which fished for scallops, all of whom were written to regarding the project and its aims. Of these, 23 make the majority of landings and these vessels were actively approached to have units fitted. The first unit was fitted in Shetland in April 2013 with a total of fifteen VMS units fitted throughout the period of the project. A data sharing agreement (Appendix 1: Data sharing agreement) between the NAFC Marine Centre and each SSMO licence holder participating in the study was carried out in order to provide the fishermen with security as to how and when their data would be used. Fishermen were also provided with log in details for the Succorfish online database (see Section 2.2) so that they could view their own activity online. Initially the units were set to report every three minutes but this was later changed to every ten minutes with locational information stored in a secure database and accessed via the internet. The change in ping frequency from three to ten minutes was an operational decision in order to maximise the quantity of information relevant to the vessel activity and the aims of the project without losing valuable information on fishing activity. Pings were transmitted via satellite but in the event of no satellite coverage, the units stored the information until it was possible to re-transmit the data.

It has previously been shown in a field study that swimming speed of European eels in the Baltic Sea slowed when crossing a 130 kV AC power cable. However, no details of fish behaviour during passage over the cable were recorded in this study, and it is not known whether the observed reduction in swimming speed was due to the MF associated with the cable, or some other factor. The aim of the present study was to observe the response of European eels at the silver eel stage of their life-cycle to an AC MF of approximately 9.6 \u00b5T at a fine scale in a controlled laboratory setting. During 28 trials, each lasting 4 hours and using a single eel per trial, 10 eels (termed \u201cswimmers\u201d) made between 1 and 43 passes through coils. There was no evidence of a difference in movement due to the MF nor observations of startle or other obvious behavioural changes associated with the magnetic fields. Level of movement decreased as the experiments progressed and increased with eel size. Eel passage through coils was unaffected by whether or not they were activated. In applying these results it must be kept in mind that the sample size was small, nocturnal behaviour was not tested and the field strengths were lower than might be encountered in the wild in some situations.\u003C\/p\u003E","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"pdf","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.scotland.gov.uk\/Resource\/0048\/00484920.pdf","title":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Vol 6 No 8"}],"identifier":"ec3c29d6-c49d-4b83-afa6-0fb9fa2eccdd","issued":"2015-09-14","keyword":["European eel","fish behaviour","marine renewables"],"landingPage":"http:\/\/data.marine.gov.scot\/dataset\/effects-ac-magnetic-fields-mfs-swimming-activity-european-eels-anguilla-anguilla","modified":"2015-09-14","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Reports"},"title":"Effects of AC Magnetic Fields (MFs) on Swimming Activity in European Eels Anguilla anguilla","bureauCode":["000:00"],"programCode":["000:000"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"fn":"Marine Scotland Science","hasEmail":"mailto:noemailprovided@usa.gov"},"description":"\u003Cp\u003EScottish Marine and Freshwater Science Vol 6 No 9\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EEffects of mains frequency (50Hz) magnetic fields (MF) on behaviour of captive Atlantic salmon were examined in a large arena. Fish swam spontaneously within the arena passing from one side to the other through Helmholtz coils (arranged in four pairs) that penetrated a net barrier. When activated, a uniform intensity MF was generated between coils within a pair. Salmon were considered in two size categories: large fish (62-85 cm) and smaller post-smolts (24-41 cm). Large fish were tested in groups of six and considered at the individual level. For each fish, measurements were made of the times to approach, traverse and leave an activated coil pair (intensity = 95 \u00b5T) on first encounter across defined distances. These times were compared with previous passage times for the same coil in a deactivated state across similar distances. There were no significant differences in approach, traverse or departure times associated with activation state of the coils. Post-smolts (18 trials of groups of six fish) were exposed to three 30-min periods of MF at 1.3, 11.4 and 95 \u00b5T with 30-min controls before each treatment. The sequence in which the different MF levels were presented was varied sequentially. There was no evidence that the numbers of fish passing through the coils depended on the sequence in which the MF intensities were presented (p = 0.18) or on the field intensity itself. Similarly, the numbers of shoals passing through coils did not depend on sequence or field intensity.

It is important to note that these data were collected for varying purposes, but that the objectives of these studies were not necessarily the same as those of this 5 report. Although this is inevitable in any large scale opportunistic meta-data analysis, it should be borne in mind. To facilitate analysis, a number of assumptions were made about the data. Firstly, it is assumed that fish are caught in proportion to the numbers of emigrating fish and thus that capture efficiency remains constant within years. Secondly it is assumed that the captured fish provide a representative sample of migrating fish and there is no size selection in the capture process.","description":"\u003Cp\u003EScottish Marine and Freshwater Science Vol 6 No 2\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Scottish Government has set ambitious targets for renewable power generation. Marine Renewable Energy, including wind, wave and tidal power are expected to contribute significantly to these targets. Information on the timing of Atlantic salmon smolt migrations is required for planning coastal development and the timing of particular activities. Information on smolt sizes is required to plan acoustic tagging studies aiming to improve understanding of fish movement and behaviour in the coastal zone. This report assessed pre-existing information on smolt migration timing and sizes. The commencement of migration was characterised as the day of the year (DoY) on which 25% of smolts had migrated (S25); the end of the migration period was characterised as the DoY on which 75% of smolts had emigrated (S75). The start and end of the migration period varied with elevation and over time, but not as a predictable function of geographical location (latitude and longitude). Thus, a single coastal migration DoY range (S25 to S75) was estimated for the whole of Scotland. By including uncertainty in the predictions it was possible to identify a \u201csensitive window\u201d for development, where large numbers of migrating salmon smolts could be expected in the coastal zone. This window covers the period DoY 103-145. This envelope does not consider the time that smolts will spend in the coastal zone, so further work is required to adjust this window appropriately. It was not possible to model the spatiotemporal variability in smolt sizes given available data and resources. However, considerable inter-site and inter-annual variability was observed. The data presented here could be used to inform future acoustic tagging studies at existing sites, although it is suggested that pilot data should be obtained where work is to be carried out at new sites.\u003C\/p\u003E","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"pdf","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.scotland.gov.uk\/Resource\/0047\/00472202.pdf","title":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Vol 6 No 2"}],"identifier":"77cd68ff-ee4a-4ade-a557-39b40e9b0c7b","issued":"2015-03-09","keyword":["Atlantic Salmon","marine renewables","migration","migratory behaviour","spawning","tagging"],"landingPage":"http:\/\/data.marine.gov.scot\/dataset\/spatio-temporal-variability-scottish-smolt-emigration-times-and-sizes","modified":"2015-03-09","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Reports"},"temporal":"1966-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\/2014-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Spatio-temporal variability in Scottish smolt emigration times and sizes","bureauCode":["000:00"],"programCode":["000:000"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"fn":"Marine Scotland Science","hasEmail":"mailto:noemailprovided@usa.gov"},"describedBy":"On 25-26 February 2014, members of MASTS\u2019s DPMS Research Theme attended a workshop in Crieff to review our current knowledge of the LL\u0026amp;FL system and discuss areas of research required to address specific challenges.

Each polygon is overlaid with a grid (800 cells per ICES statistical rectangle with an average area of ca. 4.20 km2) and the polygon monetary value is divided by the number of overlapping grid cells, to equally distribute the value to all overlapping grid cells irrespective of the extent of the overlap.

Treatment of the data in this way reduces the influence of larger vessels, which generally have higher gross earnings and of those vessels fishing for relatively high value species, such as lobster and scallops, often evident in the monetary value analysis. Relative value provides an alternative representation of \u2018the value\u2019 of different fishing areas. It can indicate areas important to relatively large numbers of low earning boats, and other small, often remote sea areas which are particularly important to local boats, which may be less evident in the monetary value analysis.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe number of vessels in each grid cell is the sum of the number of polygons which overlap the cell.

The numbers of vessels analysis provides information on the spatial extent of fishing as reported during interviews and a representation of fishing intensity i.e. where most boats fish. It is not necessarily a good indicator of fishing effort, particularly for the combined (all interview) data set, or for fisheries where activity varies seasonally.

CSEMP is the main UK monitoring programme for contaminants in fish and, in Scotland, is undertaken by MSS. However, as most fish data are for liver tissue of small flatfish they are of limited use for assessing progress towards GES under Descriptor 9, as in the UK fish liver is not generally consumed.

Simulation results processed to quantify connectivity and export\/import out of\/into proposed MPA locations to assess the most suitably located sites and the replication needed. With respect to 3, year was split into quarters to consider approximate spawning windows, whilst PLD was split into 11 daily time intervals for the 18 PMF species considered. The lack of information on even the most basic behavioural attributes in most cases, such as vertical distribution in the water column, meant that species behaviour could not be considered. An existing hydrodynamic model covering Scottish waters and the compilation of a climatological flow-field to represent \u0026quot;average\u0026quot; conditions was used to predict larval transport.

Mean transport distance was mostly related to the duration of the pelagic larval phase (PLD), although season of spawning and distance to shore were also important factors. Larvae of species with a PLD = 30 days that were not solely associated with sea lochs or near-shore regions could be advected from the Celtic Sea to the Greater North Sea OSPAR sub-region. These species include tall sea pen, burrowing anemone, spiny lobster and most bivalve molluscs. Due to the limited distance between possible MPAs, connectivity among protected regions should be possible for many species with PLD = 10 d within OSPAR subregions. Those species at risk of local impacts due to low connectivity were species with a short PLD (burrowing amphipod, northern feather star, pink soft coral and northern sea fan) and\/or present only in a small number of MPAs (heart cockle and horse mussel). Possible MPAs that were too close to shore to resolve in this analysis are also likely to be less dispersive environments than open water possible MPA sites. The model estimates of larval transport could be significantly influenced by larval behaviour and hatching times, highlighting the need for better information on these parameters. Information on habitat suitability is also needed to resolve suitable settlement areas. Future high resolution hydrodynamic models should allow us to improve our estimation of connectivity.\u003C\/p\u003E","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"data","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.scotland.gov.uk\/Resource\/0042\/00427638.pdf","title":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Vol 4 No 2"}],"identifier":"66eac2a7-d056-47fa-bbf2-5f9f613c7863","issued":"2014-10-31","keyword":["benthic invertebrates","benthos","biophysical modelling","physical oceanography","transport"],"landingPage":"http:\/\/data.marine.gov.scot\/dataset\/connectivity-benthic-priority-marine-species-within-scottish-mpa-network","modified":"2014-12-12","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Reports"},"title":"Connectivity of benthic priority marine species within the Scottish MPA network","bureauCode":["000:00"],"programCode":["000:000"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"fn":"Marine Scotland Science Enquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:noemailprovided@usa.gov"},"describedBy":"Tables describing the annual cycles of physical (temperature, salinity, density and water column stability), chemical (nitrate, orthophosphate, silicate, ammonia and oxygen saturation) and biological (particulate organic carbon, particulate organic nitrogen, chlorophyll-a and phaeophytin) parameters are presented for twenty six sub-areas of Scottish coastal and oceanic waters. These tables have been derived from observations made by the Marine Laboratory, Aberdeen, during the period 1960-2010.","description":"\u003Cp\u003EScottish Marine and Freshwater Science Vol 4 No 1\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EFor over 100 years Marine Scotland, under various names, has conducted marine research in the waters around Scotland. From the earliest times this included the measurement of physical and chemical parameters at standard sections worked routinely over a number of years, and at ad hoc stations whose timing and location were determined by individual projects. This paper presents summary tables of a selection of these parameters in twenty six sub-areas of Scottish waters selected because of their distinct hydrographic characteristics. Only data from 1960 have been used for a number of reasons. Prior to that time salinity, a vital parameter used when determining the origins and history of particular water masses, was determined chemically. Initially salinity samples were analysed by the Laboratory of the Government Chemist, with varying degrees of accuracy and quality control. In later years the analysis was taken on by staff of Marine Scotland, Marine Laboratory, Aberdeen, where it has stayed through to the present day. Many of the chemical techniques presently used for the determination of nutrient concentrations were standardised in the early 1960s. Therefore, data prior to this are of limited value and must be used with caution. Since the early 1960s, analysis techniques, and to a large extent the analysts themselves, have been fairly consistent within the Marine Laboratory. The effect of this has been a high quality, internally consistent data set. Any collection of environmental data, such as that which exists within the Marine Laboratory, is of most value if it can be readily accessible and in a form useful to potential \u0022customers\u0022. Today, this means a computer archived database which may be used in a flexible, userfriendly and problem-oriented manner.

Dogwhelks of all sizes (juveniles to adults) were collected from five of the sites. Results of the present survey were compared to the ten previous surveys and assessed against the recently developed Oslo and Paris Commission (OSPAR) assessment criteria. The degree of imposex (RPSI and VDSI measurements) in toothed adults from sites within Sullom Voe in 2009 show that these sites continue to be more impacted by TBT from the oil terminal activities than populations at sites in Yell Sound. Throughout Sullom Voe, RPSI and VDSI values in adults (RPSI 0.01-1.08%; VDSI 1.30-3.67) were generally lower than, the values in the 2007 survey. The RPSI and VDSI values of populations outside the Voe (RPSI 0.00-0.67%; VDSI 0.2-3.24), in the well flushed waters of Yell Sound, were much lower than at sites within the Voe. As in previous surveys, the degree of imposex in populations in Yell Sound generally decreases with distance from Sullom Voe. In 2007, four sites within Sullom Voe still showed evidence of females with blocked reproductive tracts, causing sterility in some of the population. For the first time, the 2009 survey shows that at no sites was there evidence of sterility in any of the populations. The RPSI and VDSI measurements at the sites within the Voe show that these populations can continue to reproduce. The levels of RPSI in particular have decreased considerably from 2007, with values having fallen at every site except Billia Skerry (3) and Moss Bank \/ Grunna Taing (14) where small increases were observed. For the first time since the survey commenced in 1987, substantial decreases in VDSI at both sites within the voe and at the boundary with Yell Sound have been observed, reducing the OSPAR classification of some sites from D to C or B (notably at Voxter Ness (10), such that population-level effects should no longer be being caused by TBT. At sites in Yell Sound there was also a general trend to decreasing VDSI compared to 2007, however two sites, Billia Skerry (3) and Moss Bank \/ Grunna Taing (14), showed substantial increases in VDSI. In the case of Billia Skerry, this was reflected throughout the smaller juvenile size classes, suggesting that this may be the result of locally recently increased exposure to TBT, but the potential cause of this is unclear. Generally, the survey indicates continued improvement in imposex incidence across the area, likely resulting from reduced inputs from shipping to the area as a result of the IMO TBT ban on large vessels in 2008.","description":"\u003Cp\u003EScottish Marine and Freshwater Science Volume 1 No. 1\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis report provides the results and assessment of a survey carried out by Marine Scotland Science, Marine Laboratory, Aberdeen as part of a rocky shore monitoring programme undertaken by Aquatic Survey and Monitoring Limited, commissioned by the Shetland Oil Terminal Environmental Advisory Group (SOTEAG), and funded by the Sullom Voe Association.\u003C\/p\u003E","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"data","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.scotland.gov.uk\/Resource\/Doc\/295194\/0106887.pdf","title":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Volume 1 No. 1"}],"identifier":"e865108b-86da-43c3-8251-7c4f63702322","issued":"2014-10-24","keyword":["dogwhelk","Shetland","Sullom Voe","TBT"],"landingPage":"http:\/\/data.marine.gov.scot\/dataset\/soetag-rocky-shore-monitoring-programme-tbt-conatmination-sullom-voe-shetland-2009-dogwhelk","modified":"2014-10-24","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Reports"},"temporal":"2009-08-01T00:00:00+01:00\/2010-03-31T00:00:00+01:00","title":"SOETAG Rocky Shore Monitoring Programme.

Firstly, how has the state of the community changed over the last decade, from 1999 to 2008; the period of particular interest to the current QSR. Secondly, how does the state of the community over the period 2004 to 2008 (i.e. now) compare with that prevalent during the eight-year period when data were first available for analysis. For the North Sea IBTS time series, data were available from 1983 onwards, giving a \u201creference period\u201d of 1983 to 1990. Other data sets commenced later than this, the Scottish West Coast Groundfish Survey commenced in 1986, so the \u201creference period\u201d for this data set was 1986 to 1993. Detrimental trends were assigned a \u201cred\u201d colour code and beneficial trends \u201cgreen\u201d. Where no discernable trend was apparent, an \u201corange\u201d colour code was applied. Five separate aspects of composition, structure and function of the demersal fish community were considered, and a judgement was made based on the trends observed in the 15 univariate community metrics applied to the groundfish survey data. Linear regression was used to make an assessment of metric trends over the last decade. In comparing the current situation with the earlier \u201creference period\u201d, mean metric values over the period 2004 to 2008 were determined and the assessment was scored red or green depending on whether the recent mean value differed by more than one standard deviation either side of the mean value determined for the \u201creference period\u201d. In OSPAR Regions IV and V, only single data sets were available for analysis, each covering only a fraction of the whole region concerned. For these regions therefore, assessment was straightforward. In OSPAR Region II, data sets were available that covered almost the entire region, allowing a single \u201canalytical\u201d assessment to be made based on all the data from throughout the region. In OSPAR Region III, data were available that more or less covered the entire region, but from several different surveys, not a single co-ordinated survey. This necessitated the division of the Region into seven sub-regions, with each sub-region assessed individually. To determine an overall regional assessment, weighted averages were then calculated. Red cells were given a value of 1, orange a value of 2, and green a value of 3, and cells were then weighted by the number of ICES statistical rectangles in the sub-regions. For the final regional assessment, weighted average scores greater than 2.35 were considered good and assigned a \u201cgreen\u201d code; scores of less than 1.65 were considered poor and assigned a \u201cred\u201d code; while scores of 1.65 to 2.35 were deemed to indicate little change and assigned an \u201corange\u201d code. This analysis revealed considerable variation between sub-regions in the way that the different aspects of the composition, structure and functioning of the fish community in OSPAR Region III had varied over time. So the same approach was applied to OSPAR Region II to determine whether the single \u201canalytical\u201d assessment had masked similar sub-regional variation. This had two benefits. Firstly, it allowed sub-regions, such as the English Channel, part of OSPAR Region II, but not covered by the single co-ordinated survey, to be included in the regional assessment. Secondly, it provided a comparison of the \u201canalytical\u201d and \u201cweighted average\u201d approaches.","description":"\u003Cp\u003EScottish Marine and Freshwater Science Volume 1 No 2\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETo date, OSPAR has largely been responsible for the development of an ecosystem approach to the management of marine natural resources. Ten Ecological Quality Issues have been identified, with the intention of setting Ecological Quality Objectives (EcoQOs) for each issue. Since 2000, this scheme has been developed and piloted in the North Sea. Fish Communities is the fifth in the list of Ecological Quality Issues, and is considered to be one of three community-level issues. In addressing concerns regarding anthropogenically induced change in fish communities therefore, a community-level approach has been widely adopted. This has generally involved the application of univariate metrics to groundfish survey data to quantify change in various aspects of the community\u2019s composition, structure and function. The element of Ecological Quality for the North Sea fish community focuses on \u201cchanges in the proportion of large fish and hence the average weight and average maximum length of the fish community\u201d, thus clearly identifying the need for a community size composition metric as the \u201cindicator\u201d on which to base an EcoQO for the \u201cfish community\u201d Ecological Quality Issue. The chosen metric, the Large Fish Indicator (LFI) was eventually defined as \u201cthe proportion by weight of fish greater than 40cm in length\u201d, based on ICES first quarter (Q1) International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) data. The LFI was intended to be an indicator of the \u201cgeneral health\u201d of the demersal fish community. However, other aspects of the composition, structure and functioning of fish communities, such as abundance, biomass, productivity, species richness, species diversity and mean life-history trait composition, can also be summarised using univariate metrics. Any one, or all, of these alternative metrics might also be considered to be indicative of the \u201chealth\u201d of fish communities. The LFI was chosen ahead of these alternative metrics because it was believed to be particularly sensitive to variation in fishing pressure, and therefore to indicate directly the effect of fishing on the state of the fish community. But this raises the question as to whether one indicator is sufficient to inform on the general health of the demersal fish community, or is a suite of indicators necessary in order to provide information on various different aspects of a community\u2019s composition, structure and function? In this assessment of the state of the demersal community in four OSPAR Regions, fifteen univariate metrics are applied to groundfish survey data to quantify changes in five main aspects of community composition, structure and function: abundance\/biomass\/productivity; size composition; species richness; species diversity; and life-history trait composition (Table 1). Bottom trawl surveys have been carried out as part of the traditional annual fisheries management process for several decades. These surveys routinely provide point estimates of the abundance at length of each species sampled; therefore providing ideal data sets for the application of univariate community metrics. Many of these surveys have run for two or three decades now, providing appropriate time series with which to evaluate changes in the composition, structure and function of fish communities. Furthermore, most coastal European nations have been involved in survey activity, providing data from most of the continental shelf waters in the OSPAR area. In this assessment, otter trawl survey data is analysed to assess changes in the fish communities present in four OSPAR Regions (Figure 1). To assess the state of the demersal fish community in OSPAR Regions, II, III, IV and V, and make a judgement on the changes observed, it was necessary to decide what constituted \u201cbeneficial\u201d and \u201cdetrimental\u201d change. Emphasis is generally placed on conserving and restoring biodiversity; implying that declines in species diversity (both richness and evenness) are detrimental. The converse was therefore also assumed to hold. The lifehistory trait composition responses of populations and communities to anthropogenically raised levels of mortality have recently received considerable attention. Declines in population age and length at maturity, decreased community average ultimate body length, and an increase in community average growth rate are all considered to be detrimental Assessment of the \u201cState\u201d of the Demersal Fish Communities in OSPAR Regions 3 consequences. Improved management would therefore be expected to induce the opposite, beneficial trends. Established population dynamics theory predicts that size-related fishing mortality reduces the mean size and proportion of large fish in exploited populations (including non-target species taken as by-catch). This concept underpins development of the LFI as the basis for the OSPAR North Sea Fish Community EcoQO. Reductions in LFI are therefore considered detrimental. Changes in LFI were generally inversely correlated with changes in the abundance, biomass and (growth) productivity of the fish community implying that declining abundance, biomass and productivity are indicative of a fish community returning to a more natural state. The von Bertalanffy growth equation makes it clear that larger fish, closer to their ultimate body length (L8), have lower daily specific growth rates. Large fish exert a strong predation loading on small fish abundance. Since trophic transfer efficiency is around 10%, every kg of production by larger fish requires 10kg of production in their smaller prey fish populations. Specific growth rates among smaller fish are approximately twice that of larger fish, so 5kg of prey fish are required to support every kg of larger fish. Reductions in the abundance of larger fish, with the consequent reduction in predation loading on smaller prey fish, would therefore tend to result in a rapid increase in the abundance and biomass of small fish; a typical trophic cascade effect.\u003C\/p\u003E","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"pdf","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.scotland.gov.uk\/Resource\/Doc\/295194\/0099985.pdf","title":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Volume 1 No 2"}],"identifier":"2c190e42-aa88-432d-a6d4-a8b3b07b4848","issued":"2014-10-24","keyword":["demersal fish","fisheries","Large Fish Indicator"],"landingPage":"http:\/\/data.marine.gov.scot\/dataset\/assessment-state-demersal-fish-communities-ospar-regions-ii-iii-iv-and-v","modified":"2015-03-24","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Reports, Fisheries"},"temporal":"2010-03-01T00:00:00+00:00\/2010-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Assessment of the \u0026quot;State\u0026quot; of the Demersal Fish Communities in OSPAR regions II, III, IV and V","bureauCode":["000:00"],"programCode":["000:000"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"fn":"Marine Scotland Science Enquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:noemailprovided@usa.gov"},"describedBy":"To determine an overall regional assessment, weighted average scores for each aspect of the demersal fish community composition, structure and function were calculated.

Since 2000, this scheme has been developed and piloted in the North Sea. Fish Communities is the fifth in the list of Ecological Quality Issues, and is considered to be one of three community-level issues. In addressing concerns regarding anthropogenically induced change in fish communities therefore, a communitylevel approach has been widely adopted. This has generally involved the application of univariate metrics to groundfish survey data to quantify change in various aspects of the community\u2019s composition, structure and function. The element of Ecological Quality for the North Sea fish community focuses on \u201cchanges in the proportion of large fish and hence the average weight and average maximum length of the fish community\u201d, thus clearly identifying the need for a community size composition metric as the \u201cindicator\u201d on which to base an EcoQO for the \u201cfish community\u201d Ecological Quality Issue. The chosen metric, the Large Fish Indicator (LFI) was eventually defined as \u201cthe proportion by weight of fish greater than 40cm in length\u201d, based on ICES first quarter (Q1) International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) data. The LFI was intended to be an indicator of the \u201cgeneral health\u201d of the demersal fish community. Indeed DEFRA have adopted the LFI as a means of monitoring change in the trophic structure of demersal fish communities, since in marine systems, ontogenetic change and inter-specific variation in diet is so strongly linked to predator body-size. However, other aspects of the composition, structure and functioning of fish communities, such as abundance, biomass, productivity, species richness, species diversity and mean life-history trait composition, can also be summarised using univariate metrics. Any one, or all, of these alternative metrics might also be considered to be indicative of the \u201chealth\u201d of fish communities. The LFI was chosen ahead of these alternative metrics because it was believed to be particularly sensitive to variation in fishing pressure, and therefore to indicate directly the effect of fishing on the state of the fish community. But this raises the question as to whether one indicator is sufficient to inform on the general health of the demersal fish community, or is a suite of indicators necessary in order to provide information on various different aspects of a community\u2019s composition, structure and function? In this assessment of the state of the demersal community in UK waters, fifteen univariate metrics are applied to groundfish survey data to quantify changes in five main aspects of community composition, structure and function: abundance\/biomass\/productivity; size composition; species richness; species diversity; and life-history trait composition (Table 1). Bottom trawl surveys have been carried out as part of the traditional annual fisheries management process for several decades. These surveys routinely provide point estimates of the abundance at length of each species sampled; therefore providing the ideal data sets for the application univariate community metrics. Many of these surveys have run for two or three decades now, providing appropriate time series with which to evaluate changes in the composition, structure and function of fish communities. Furthermore, most coastal European nations have been involved in survey activity, providing data from most western continental shelf waters. In this assessment, otter trawl survey data is analysed to assess changes in the demersal fish communities present in the sea area that constitutes the UK\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The UK EEZ has been divided into nine principal subregions (Figure 1), and assessment of the state of the fish community in each sub-region was required. However, one of the sub-regions, the Scottish Continental Shelf, straddled the boundaries between OSPAR Regions II and III, and between ICES area IV and VI. Consequently, none of the groundfish surveys, which are normally aligned with the ICES designated marine regions, covered the entire Scottish Continental Shelf sub-region. A single assessment for the Scottish Continental Shelf was therefore not possible. The subregion had to be further sub-divided in line with the data available for analysis, and three Assessment of the \u201cState\u201d of the Demersal Fish Communities in UK Waters 2 separate assessments made for the southwestern and northeastern sectors of this large area (Figure 1). To assess the state of the demersal fish community and make a judgement on the changes observed, it was necessary to decide what constituted \u201cbeneficial\u201d and \u201cdetrimental\u201d change. Emphasis is generally placed on conserving and restoring biodiversity; implying that declines in species diversity (both richness and evenness) are detrimental. The converse was therefore also assumed to hold. The life-history trait composition responses of populations and communities to anthropogenically raised levels of mortality have recently received considerable attention. Declines in population age and length at maturity, decreased community average ultimate body length, and increased in community average growth rate are all considered to be detrimental consequences. Improved management would therefore be expected to induce the opposite, beneficial trends. Established population dynamics theory predicts that size-related fishing mortality reduces the mean size and proportion of large fish in exploited populations (including non-target species taken as by-catch). This concept underpins development of the LFI as the basis for the OSPAR North Sea Fish Community EcoQO. Reductions in LFI are therefore considered detrimental. Changes in LFI were generally inversely correlated with changes in the abundance, biomass and (growth) productivity of the fish community, implying that declining abundance, biomass and productivity are indicative of a fish community returning to a more natural undisturbed state. The von Bertalanffy growth equation makes it clear that larger fish, closer to their ultimate body length (L8), have lower daily specific growth rates. Large fish exert a strong predation loading on small fish abundance. Since trophic transfer efficiency is around 10%, every kg of production by larger fish requires 10kg of production in their smaller prey fish populations. Specific growth rates among smaller fish are approximately twice that of larger fish, so 5kg of prey fish are required to support every kg of larger fish. Reductions in the abundance of larger fish, with the consequent reduction in predation loading on smaller prey fish, would therefore tend to result in a rapid increase in the abundance and biomass of small fish; a typical trophic cascade effect. In assessing the state of the demersal fish community, two questions were addressed. Firstly, how has the state of the community changed over the last decade, from 1999 to 2008; the period of particular interest to the current report. Secondly, how does the state of the community over the period 2004 to 2008 (i.e. now) compare with that prevalent during the eight-year period when data were first available for analysis. Detrimental trends were assigned a \u201cred\u201d colour code and beneficial trends \u201cgreen\u201d (e.g. Table 2). Where no discernable trend was apparent, an \u201corange\u201d colour code was applied. Five separate aspects of composition, structure and function of the demersal fish community were considered, and a judgement was made based on the trends observed in the 15 univariate community metrics applied to the groundfish survey data. Linear regression was used to make an assessment of metric trends over the last decade. In comparing the current situation with the earlier \u201creference period\u201d, mean metric values over the period 2004 to 2008 were determined and the assessment was scored red or green depending on whether the recent mean value differed by more than one standard deviation either side of the mean value determined for the earliest possible \u201creference period\u201d.\u003C\/p\u003E","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"data","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.scotland.gov.uk\/Resource\/Doc\/295194\/0099909.pdf","title":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Report Volume 1 No 3"}],"identifier":"1a8877b1-ea84-4fd7-9934-a7e840a2154a","issued":"2014-10-21","keyword":["demersal fish","fisheries","Large Fish Indicator"],"landingPage":"http:\/\/data.marine.gov.scot\/dataset\/assessment-%E2%80%9Cstate%E2%80%9D-demersal-fish-communities-uk-waters","modified":"2014-10-21","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Reports"},"temporal":"2010-03-01T00:00:00+00:00\/2010-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Assessment of the \u201cState\u201d of the Demersal Fish Communities in UK waters","bureauCode":["000:00"],"programCode":["000:000"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"fn":"Marine Scotland Science Enquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:noemailprovided@usa.gov"},"describedBy":"This report describes a second outbreak of ISA in Scotland that occurred during 2008\/9.

Spread of the virus via movement of fish between marine sites, harvest vessels, movements of smolts and wild fish appear to have been of little or no importance. The spread is associated with hydrodynamic currents, although local intra-company activity may have caused some spread. The application of a statutory control strategy by Marine Scotland, based on the use of its established model (Anon 2000) has apparently limited the occurrence and economic impact of ISA to management area 3a; however spread within this area has been extensive. This localised waterborne spread is in contradiction to a previous outbreak in 1998\/9 which was spread over a wide geographic area by transport of fish and harvest vessels. The development of industry codes of practice and good biosecurity procedures, following the 1998\/9 outbreak, that limited marine site-to-site movement of live fish and improved disinfection of vessels and processing plant waste, may explain why the 2008\/9 spread of infection was localised. Depopulation of confirmed sites is a key element of eradication and this was achieved within 7 weeks of confirmation, although the last confirmed case suggests subclinical infection may persist undetected for months. The potential sources of ISAV infection that were investigated did not determine the origin of the 2008\/9 outbreak. Local evolution from an avirulent strain of ISAV; importation of ova; or association with movement of equipment could have caused the outbreak. The virus responsible for the 2008\/9 outbreak belongs to a different genogroup (group 1) to the 1998\/9 virus (group 3). The intensive cultivation of salmon farming, close proximity of sites and historic absence of synchronous fallowing of management areas is considered to have increased the risk of disease outbreaks and their re-emergence, such as ISA in the Shetland Islands. A policy of synchronous fallowing and stocking of sites within management area 3a is being considered by industry in consultation with Marine Scotland to address this risk. Where movement of fish occurs between sites in 1 different management areas, this represents the greatest risk of regional-scale spread of diseases such as ISA. Controls appear to have been effective in minimising that risk.\u003C\/p\u003E","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"data","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.scotland.gov.uk\/Resource\/Doc\/295194\/0103336.pdf","title":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Vol 1 No 4"}],"identifier":"f4e58247-f051-435a-942a-e6239f232313","issued":"2014-10-21","keyword":["Infectious Salmon Anaemia","Salmon"],"landingPage":"http:\/\/data.marine.gov.scot\/dataset\/report-epidemiology-and-control-outbreak-infectious-salmon-anaemia-shetland-islands-scotland","modified":"2016-03-17","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Reports, Aquaculture"},"temporal":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\/2010-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Report into the Epidemiology and Control of an Outbreak of Infectious Salmon Anaemia in the Shetland Islands, Scotland","bureauCode":["000:00"],"programCode":["000:000"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"fn":"Marine Scotland Science Enquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:noemailprovided@usa.gov"},"describedBy":"In September 2007, two species of deep water fish were taken by the research vessel FRV Scotia from the Rockall Trough, to the west of Scotland (Fig. 1).

As a precautionary measure to safeguard marine top predators, particularly seabirds at internationally important colonies in and around the Firth of Forth, an area off the east coast of Scotland, from Rattray Head to St Abbs, was closed to industrial fishing for sandeels in 2000. High levels of recruitment in 1999 and 2000, combined with a lack of any significant fishing activity in 1999, resulted in an immediate and substantial increase in the biomass of sandeels on the Wee Bankie grounds in 2000; the first year of the sandeel closure. Since 2001, sandeel biomass has steadily declined to levels in 2007 that were similar to those observed in 1997 and 1998 when the sandeel fishery in the area was active. In the absence of sustained recruitment, consumption by marine top predators, along with other causes of natural mortality, have exceeded growth production in the population. Closing the area to fishing has not been sufficient to ensure high abundances of sandeels in the area. Recruitment of young sandeels, at or above long-term average levels, is also necessary, and since this is primarily governed by natural process, this may be beyond the capacity of fisheries management alone to achieve. Variation in the abundance and feeding ecology of gadoid predators in the study area was unrelated to variation in sandeel abundance and so remained unaffected by closure of the fishery. Numbers of guillemots, razorbills, puffins and kittiwakes recorded at sea in the study area all appeared to increase with closure of the fishery, and then subsequently to decline again as local sandeel abundance declined. The increase in auk abundance at sea may well have resulted from an influx of non-breeding birds. Only the breeding performance of kittiwakes at the Isle of May appeared related to variation in local sandeel abundance. Simply closing offshore areas close to top predator colonies may not be sufficient to guarantee the long term prospects of predators at these locations.\u003C\/p\u003E","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"data","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.scotland.gov.uk\/Resource\/Doc\/295194\/0099668.pdf","title":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Volume 1 No 6"}],"identifier":"128c9966-0b58-459c-bb1b-70cd52fb9754","issued":"2014-10-21","keyword":["fisheries","monitoring","sandeel","Wee Bankie"],"landingPage":"http:\/\/data.marine.gov.scot\/dataset\/monitoring-consequences-northwestern-north-sea-sandeel-fishery-closure","modified":"2014-10-21","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Reports"},"temporal":"2010-04-01T00:00:00+01:00\/2010-04-01T00:00:00+01:00","title":"Monitoring the Consequences of the Northwestern North Sea Sandeel Fishery Closure","bureauCode":["000:00"],"programCode":["000:000"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"fn":"Marine Scotland Science Enquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:noemailprovided@usa.gov"},"describedBy":"This study aimed to investigate the immediate behavioural and short term survival effects of electrofishing on Ensis spp.; identify the main non-target species likely to be affected by electrofishing; determine whether exposure to electrofishing affects invertebrate survival in the short term; and to define the field properties of the electrodes used through a combination of in situ boat observations and tank based experiments.on the basis that a research scientist was on board at all times the equipment was in use.","description":"\u003Cp\u003EScottish Marine and Freshwater Science Vol 5 No 14\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ETrawling and tank based trials were conducted to assess whether electrofishing (which is currently prohibited under EU regulations) for razor clams Ensis siliqua and E. arquatus affects survival and behaviour patterns in Ensis spp. and non-target species.

No mortalities were recorded as a direct result of the fishing equipment or electric field generated and any induced behavioural responses in non-target species were exhibited for a maximum of 10 minutes following exposure.

Tank trials indicated that exposure to an electric field typical of that generated through electrofishing by the vessels involved in this project did not affect short term (5 days) survival in razor clams, surf clams, starfish or hermit crabs.

Density surface modelling was undertaken for fulmars, gannets and auk species. 1.3 Ground-based counts involved an ornithologist undertaking a bird and marine mammal survey from 14 vantage points along the west coast of Lewis. These counts were co-ordinated as much as possible with the aerial survey, and were used to gain more information about more difficult to identify species, or undertaken in places known to be important for seabirds but likely to be missed by the aerial survey. A further vantage point study covering the majority of Loch Roag was also undertaken, covering areas outside the aerial survey study area.","description":"\u003Cp\u003EScottish Marine and Freshwater Science Vol 5 No 9\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EBy 2020 the percentage of Scotland\u0027s energy coming from renewable sources will increase.

At this stage organisations were asked to notify the SFCC if they either did not collect smolt data, or did collect smolt data. If an organisation identified that it did collect smolt data it was requested to fill in a brief meta-data questionnaire for each monitoring site as detailed in Appendix A.1. At this initial stage it was made clear that all data provided should be considered to be in the public domain and subject to Freedom of Information Scotland Act (FOISA) and Environmental Information Regulations (EIR) considerations","description":"\u003Cp\u003EScottish Marine and Freshwater Science Vol 5 No 6\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis project was undertaken in the context of the National Research and Monitoring Strategy for Diadromous Fish (NRMSD) to investigate the potentialfor interactions between diadromous fish and wind, wave and tidal renewable energy developments. By canvassing Scotland\u2019s geographical area, the SFCC believe that the absolute spatial coverage of smolt monitoring locations has been identified. Datasets identified from 13 organisations at 31 locations were requested, resulting in the provision of these datasets. During the project, the fish species scope was expanded to include trout after initially being focused on Atlantic salmon. A total of 126,368 individual fish length measurements and a further separate dataset featuring 292,427 smolt counts were provided. While the majority of smolt trapping was found to occur using rotary screw trap methods, a range of alternative strategies are deployed. Data recording procedures and resolutions were found to vary significantly between organisations and in some cases within organisations. Temporal coverage is also variable with information becoming increasingly limited before 2006. The largest dataset spans 37 years, that of Spey Dam currently operated by Spey Foundation. Out of 31 sites 16 featured individual fish length (1mm) measurements and 2 featured 5mm and 10mm categorical fish length measurements. The remaining 13 datasets were provided as total fish count level observations. 18 of 31 smolt monitoring sites are operated on river main stems, with the remainder on 2nd order tributary rivers. While data are provided in a standard format, considerations relating to crosscompatibility remain specifically around the means by which recordings are made where; fishing did not occur, fishing did occur without the trap being checked, and fishing did occur with the trap being checked resulting in a catch of 0. Strategies for recording the beginning and end of the trapping season also exhibited varied approaches, a caveat which should be considered during further analysis. Further work is recommended to fully quantify the availability of data collected on other fish species captured (while smolt monitoring) and that of river flow and water temperature. Pending analysis by Marine Scotland Science, this collaborative approach may have provided data collected at a local catchment scale, which is also capable of informing research of a national-scale.

Subsequently further sets of SNPs were identified that allowed finer resolution of regional units until, in areas where the river coverage was sufficient and which were of significant interest, SNPs were identified which allowed assignments to the rivers represented in the baseline. Further, techniques were developed which allowed individual fish to be excluded from the analysis if their assignment confidence was not high (i.e. there was no strong evidence that they originated from regions\/rivers represented within the baseline). In this way, firstly fish could be assigned to region, and then within some of the regions individuals could be either assigned to river, or excluded from the analysis.","description":"\u003Cp\u003EScottish Marine and Freshwater Science Vol 5 No 5\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThis report examines utility of assigning fish to river in Scotland using Single Nucleotide Polymorphic (SNP) markers.

Exclusion techniques have also been examined as to their effectiveness in screening out fish from reporting regions not represented in the baseline. The procedures developed and outlined here show a multi-stage process can be employed to assign fish to origin. Firstly fish are assigned to a regional reporting unit. Fish from rivers not represented in the baseline within regional reporting units of interest are then excluded from the analysis, before finally fish are assigned to their river of origin.

A short UK Integrated Marine Observing Network (UK-IMON) demonstration study was commissioned to monitor coastal waters for the first half of 2013 for the carbonate chemistry parameters, Total Alkalinity (TA) and Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). 3. The project was divided into two distinct parts, namely a preliminary feasibility study, to examine the use of moored water samplers to collect water samples for the analysis of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and discrete sampling at various locations around the UK for Total Alkalinty (TA) and DIC analysis. 4. Automated water samplers deployed on existing instrumented moorings may provide a cost effective means of collecting water samples for monitoring ocean acidification in coastal waters and a preliminary assessment of the utility of an automated water sampler for monitoring DIC was undertaken. A small but statistically significant difference was found between the concentrations of DIC measured in water samples collected simultaneously using an automated water sampler and rosette samples. At the present time it is not possible to determine whether this difference is due to the way samples are collected by the automated sampler or small differences in the way the two sets of samples were processed. 5. The authors recommend that a further, more detailed comparison should be undertaken to include a moored sampler with sample preservation. The introduction of a procedure to minimise aeration of samples during processing and filtration, together with any effect of long-term (weeks) storage of samples (during automated sampler deployment) on sample integrity should also be investigated.\u003C\/p\u003E","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"data","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.scotland.gov.uk\/Resource\/0044\/00442616.pdf","title":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Vol 5 No 1"}],"identifier":"f7d34c2b-71e1-4dfb-9d70-532b15728388","issued":"2014-10-06","keyword":["ocean acidification"],"landingPage":"http:\/\/data.marine.gov.scot\/dataset\/uk-ocean-acidification-coastal-monitoring-network-expanding-network-defra-contract","modified":"2015-03-24","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Reports, Monitoring"},"temporal":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\/2013-08-31T00:00:00+01:00","title":"UK Ocean Acidification Coastal Monitoring Network - Expanding the Network - Defra Contract C5801\/ME5309","bureauCode":["000:00"],"programCode":["000:000"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"fn":"Marine Scotland Science Enquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:noemailprovided@usa.gov"},"describedBy":"Report reviewing the state of the degree of hazardous substances monitoring under various programmes: The UK Clean Seas Environment Monitoring Programme (CSEMP), OSPAR CEMP determinands, Water Framework Directive (WFD), and methodologies developed by Marine Scotland.","description":"\u003Cp\u003EScottish Marine and Freshwater Science Volume 1 No 10\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe marine environment acts as a sink for many hazardous substances, including persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and trace metals. Many of these compounds are toxic, persistent, bioaccumulative and can be prone to long range transport. Their sources and pathways into the marine environment are diverse with most hazardous substances being produced by anthropogenic activities. Some are, or have been, produced intentionally (such as brominated flame retardants, BFRs) whilst others are by-products of industrial processes (such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dioxins). Direct or indirect release to rivers, from industrial discharges and from sewage works discharges, are a major source of a range of hazardous substances. Historically the biggest sources of hazardous substances to the Scottish environment were from heavy industry (steelworks, mining and gasworks), however, increased regulation and closure of some of these industries has reduced contaminant inputs from these sources. Run-off from urban areas and atmospheric deposition continue to be diffuse sources of hazardous substances to the marine environment. Due to the persistent nature of many hazardous substances, high concentrations can still be found in the sediments of industrialised and urbanised estuaries as a result of historical inputs. A number of POPs and trace metals have been highlighted as a cause for concern and have been the subject of extensive study and international regulation. Some contaminants have been monitored for many years and are often called legacy contaminants. Legacy contaminants include trace metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and chlorobiphenyls (PCBs) but are still of concern, despite reductions in inputs, as they persist in the marine environment for many years. Others have only recently been highlighted as cause for concern and added to monitoring programmes and are often referred to as emerging contaminants. Examples of emerging contaminants are short chain chlorinated parrafins (SCCPs) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs). Attempts have been made to create emission inventories for a number of hazardous substances. Breivik et al.1 created a global emission inventory for PCB congeners and Prevedouros et al.2 estimated a European consumption and atmospheric emissions inventory for pentabromo diphenyl ethers. This review is an update of the review undertaken in 20043 by Marine Scotland to identify the hazardous substances monitoring requirements, what hazardous substance data is currently held for the Scottish marine environment and identify any gaps in information that may require further monitoring or method development.\u003C\/p\u003E","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"data","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.scotland.gov.uk\/Resource\/Doc\/295194\/0099911.pdf","title":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Vol 1 No 10"}],"identifier":"332e547a-18f3-4024-8cd8-dd1604c83c30","issued":"2014-10-03","keyword":["contaminants","Hazardous Substances"],"landingPage":"http:\/\/data.marine.gov.scot\/dataset\/review-hazardous-substances-scottish-marine-environment-update-2010","modified":"2014-10-03","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Reports"},"temporal":"1999-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\/2010-04-01T00:00:00+01:00","title":"A review of hazardous substances in the Scottish marine environment: update 2010","bureauCode":["000:00"],"programCode":["000:000"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"fn":"Marine Scotland Science Enquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:noemailprovided@usa.gov"},"describedBy":"The main aim of this manual is to provide a photographic identification guide for the species most frequently found in Scottish coastal waters, with the exception of infraorder Brachyura.

All wave and tidal stream energy \ndevelopments, including those in The Crown Estate\u0027s (TCE) first leasing round in the \nPentland Firth and Orkney waters, will be eligible to compete for the prize, under the \ncondition that they are in a site in Scottish waters leased by TCE. \nIn the spirit of encouraging rapid development of wave and tidal energy, and to give \nopportunities for other projects to compete for the Saltire Prize, TCE and the Scottish \nGovernment are working in partnership to prepare plans for a further Scottish leasing round \nfor wave and tidal projects. This leasing round is entirely separate and in addition to the \nleasing in the Pentland Firth and Orkney waters. A scoping paper on the proposed \ngeographic areas to be leased for the Further Scottish Leasing Round was published and \ninterested parties were invited to comment. \nSubsequently and partly in response to comments received on the Scoping Study, Marine \nScotland has undertaken further analysis of the proposed areas. The results of this work are \ndescribed in this report and collectively known as Regional Locational Guidance (RLG). The \nRLG is provided primarily to assist developers interested in competing for the Saltire Prize to \nidentify and develop projects rapidly, but may also be of interest to planners and regulators. \nThe RLG collates and presents a range of information relevant to the development process \nand based on this, Marine Scotland\u2019s appreciation of the physical characteristics and \nthe relative degree of constraints in these areas. Developers are strongly encouraged to \ntake the information in the RLG into account when selecting and pursuing site \ndevelopments, since it may be material to the consents process.

However, before a proper evaluation can be made, such elevated levels of suspended sediment should be set against the natural pattern of sedimentation in the marine environment. To understand the pattern of natural sedimentation in a hydrographically dynamic environment, this study measured suspended sediment concentrations, settled sediment levels, near-bed current speeds and wind speeds in the Firth of Lorn special area of conservation between December 2008 and March 2009. Background sediment concentrations were found to vary within the 2 \u2013 13 \u03bcl l-1 range, with sediment concentrations rapidly increasing above 17 \u03bcl l-1 during strong gales from the south. Maximum concentrations of suspended sediment reach 60 \u03bcl l-1, with minimum levels typically 1 \u03bcl l-1. The study suggests that a prerequisite for high concentrations in suspended load are high levels of settled sediments. Northeast residual currents correspond with periods of high particle suspension with a possible explanation of this being that such flow patterns transport sediment to the site. Tidal currents in the Firth of Lorn caused regular 5 \u03bcl l-1 and 1 \u03bcl l-1 fluctuations in suspended sand (particle size 50 \u2013 500 \u03bcm) and suspended silt (particle size 4 \u2013 58 \u03bcm) respectively. Overall, the study suggests that tide and wind driven currents can explain much of the patterns observed in sedimentation, but features specific to the site, such as the islands and sand banks in close proximity, also influence the suspended load.\u003C\/p\u003E","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"data","accessURL":"http:\/\/www.scotland.gov.uk\/Resource\/Doc\/295194\/0107877.pdf","title":"SCOTTISH MARINE AND FRESHWATER SCIENCE VOLUME 1 NO 19"}],"identifier":"f31e674e-3268-42fe-a6d7-c11464b1d1e6","issued":"2014-09-01","keyword":["sedimentation"],"landingPage":"http:\/\/data.marine.gov.scot\/dataset\/sedimentation-firth-lorn-marine-special-area-conservation","modified":"2014-09-01","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Scottish Marine and Freshwater Science Reports"},"spatial":"POLYGON ((-5.91339111328 56.1179981939, -5.91339111328 56.3134900683, -5.55908203125 56.3134900683, -5.55908203125 56.1179981939))","temporal":"2008-12-01T00:00:00+00:00\/2010-11-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Sedimentation in the Firth of Lorn, Marine Special Area of Conservation","bureauCode":["000:00"],"programCode":["000:000"]}]}
